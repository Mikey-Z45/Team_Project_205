Instructions

2. A gui window will open up, enter a web address into the field
3. Press the Submit button
4. Another window will pop up displaying all images on the site with those with faces showing squares on their faces.

Future work
What we could have done to improve the program would be refining the gui and making it only display images
with faces instead of all images. We could also improve the webscraper as it doesn't work for every site or
even many sites.
